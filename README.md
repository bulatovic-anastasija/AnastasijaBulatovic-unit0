# Pre-work - *TIPSY*

**TIPSY** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Anastasija Bulatovic**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

    The prework assignment took me a while as I have never used XCode before. Before even beginning the project I had to spend a couple hours updating my computer's operating system, and then the XCode program itself. The whole process is quite time consuming, and the placment of different features with XCode can be confusing for first time users. I expect that I will get more comfortable as time goes on, but this first time was complicated. 

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
